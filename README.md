# Credit-Risk-Analysis
Credit risks are a commonly observed phenomenon in areas of finance that relate to mortgages, credit cards, and other kinds of loans. There is always a probability that the borrower may not get back with the amount. Traditionally, it refers to the risk that a lender may not receive the owed principal and interest, which results in an interruption of cash flows and increased costs for collection.
