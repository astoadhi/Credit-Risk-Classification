# Credit-Risk-Analysis

Credit risk is regarded as one of the most significant and substantial risks within the industry.
So this project aim is to predict the loan status (default or non-default) based on the given features related to the borrower and the loan itself.


# The Challenge

The team faces a critical challenge: how to effectively predict the likelihood of loan defaults. Incorrectly assessing risk can lead to significant financial losses for lenders, while overly stringent criteria can exclude deserving borrowers.

# The Solution

The author collect some data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset/data), including borrower demographics (age, income, employment), loan characteristics (amount, interest rate, purpose), and credit history information.

# Feature Engineering

The author use some features engineering to capture meaningful insights:

One-hot encoding: They transform categorical variables like home ownership and loan intent into numerical representations.
Feature scaling: They standardize numerical features like age and income to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

The team explores various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to find the best model for their task. They split the data into training and testing sets, train the models on the training data, and evaluate their performance on the unseen test data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Model Interpretation and Refinement

After selecting the optimal model, the data scientists delve into its inner workings to understand the factors driving loan defaults. They use techniques like feature importance analysis to identify the most influential variables, allowing them to gain valuable insights into borrower behavior and risk factors.

# Deployment 

Once the model is validated, it is integrated into the loan application process. The model provides real-time risk assessments for each application, enabling underwriters to make more informed decisions.![](https://github.com/astoadhi/Credit-Risk-Classification/blob/main/images/credit%20risk%20prediction.png)

This story highlights the power of data science in transforming the lending industry. By leveraging data-driven insights, lenders can make more informed, fair, and sustainable lending decisions.
